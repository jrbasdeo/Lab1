                I recently encountered a visual bug where the style
                I was attempting to apply to an SVG element just wasn’t
                working. My first instinct when debugging a tricky 
                styling issue is to fire up Chrome Dev Tools and attempt
                a sanity-test. I usually start by setting the misbehaving 
                element to a noisy and ugly CSS color value like ‘blue’ or 
                ‘red’ and examine any clues.

                What started as a hashtag charity campaign evidently 
                transformed into a much larger project.

                Given Eric’s prolific work on CSS, it was proposed that 
                the hex-value #663399, a shade of purple, be aliased to 
                “beccapurple.”
