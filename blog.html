                <p>Trees live in your fan brush, but you have to scare them out. Let that brush dance around there and play. You have freedom here. The only guide is your heart.</p>
                <p>You've got to learn to fight the temptation to resist these things. Just let them happen. I'm a water fanatic. I love water. Just let this happen. We just let this flow right out of our minds.</p>

                <p>Maybe there's a happy little Evergreen that lives here. Let's put some happy little bushes on the other side now. Even the worst thing we can do here is good. It's hard to see things when you're too close. Take a step back and look. With something so strong, a little bit can go a long way.</p>
                <p>See how easy it is to create a little tree right in your world. It's a super day, so why not make a beautiful sky? You can spend all day playing with mountains. Paint anything you want on the canvas. Create your own world.</p>

                <p>It's so important to do something every day that will make you happy. What the devil. Talk to trees, look at the birds. Whatever it takes. This is your world. Maybe we got a few little happy bushes here, just covered with snow. Remember how free clouds are. They just lay around in the sky all day long.</p>
                <p>There are no limits in this world. Trees get lonely too, so we'll give him a little friend. We don't really know where this goes - and I'm not sure we really care.</p>

                What started as a hashtag charity campaign evidently 
                transformed into a much larger project.

                Given Eric’s prolific work on CSS, it was proposed that 
                the hex-value #663399, a shade of purple, be aliased to 
                “beccapurple.”
